# Canon-Mark - Canon's companion for Annotations

## Usage

Use Canon to retrieve verses from the scriptures, with the "-v" (verbose) output flag as an input into canonmk, optionally with a "-n" (numbers) flag to include verse numbers.

Canonmk will search for your saved annotations in the `~/.canon/marks` directory.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Highlight words within verses
- [ ] Support adding a new highlight (nobody wants to do that manually!)
